I have been looking into this respect ttl thing. Looks like in all the solace forums they are suggesting that is setting be activated on the solace admin side.

Then the ttl can be set on particular message or on connectionFactory level. 0 should mean its infinite.

https://docs.solace.com/Solace-JMS-API/API-Properties.htm#jms_properties_39190069_304470
Its true by default.
And it seems like the default ttl or any message is unlimited

https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/jms/javax/jms/MessageProducer.html#setTimeToLive-long-
The closest thing I found in camel to this ttl thing is:
https://camel.apache.org/components/3.13.x/eips/message-expiration.html

Questions:
1. Why is ttl thing coming up only when transacted=true?
2. Can we not set ttl enable on all queues?
3. Even if we configure the ttl on jndi connection factory level, solace could override it using the below property.

The respect-ttl property value set at the connectionFactory level can be overridden through the InitialContext environment using SupportedProperty.SOLACE_JMS_RESPECT_TIME_TO_LIVE.

Seems like we can set disableTimeToLive and timeToLive on JmsComponent or JmsConfiguration just like transacted. If we set disableTimeToLive to true, then we should be able to proceed.
